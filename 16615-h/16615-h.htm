<span class="i2">With deeper rapture in celestial choirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathe, and with fleeter motion<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wheel in their orbits through the surgeless ocean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hearken thou like these,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Intent on her, mounting by slow degrees,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her mist of primroses within her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twilight hath folded up, and o'er the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeking remoter valleys long hath gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet hath come her sister of the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence and coolness now the earth enfold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jewels of glittering green, long mists of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hazes of nebulous silver veil the height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shake in tremors through the shadowy night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard through the stillness, as in whispered words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wandering God-guided wings of birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffle the dark. The little lives that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep hid in grass join in a long-drawn sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More softly still; and unheard through the blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The falling of innumerable dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts with grey fingers all the leaves that lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned in the heat of the consuming day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lawns and lakes lie in this night of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admitted to the majesty above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth with the starry company hath part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters hold all heaven within their heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glimmer o'er with wave-lips everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted to meet the angel lips of air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many homes of men shine near and far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace-laden as the tender evening star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The late home-coming folk anticipate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their rest beyond the passing of the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tread with sleep-filled hearts on drowsy feet.<br /></span>
 <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
<span class="i0">Oh, far away and wonderful and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this, all this. But far too many things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscuring, as a cloud of seraph wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blinding the seeker for the Lord behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fall away in weariness of mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think how far apart are I and you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved, from those spirit children who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt but one single Being long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whispering in gentleness and leaning low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of its majesty, as child to child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think upon it all with heart grown wild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing no voice, howe'er my spirit broods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No whisper from the dense infinitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This world of myriad things whose distance awes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah me; how innocent our childhood was!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I can enchant the trees and rocks, and fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dumb brown lips of earth with mystery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make them reveal or hide the god. I breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deeper pity than all love, myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother of all, but without hands to heal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too vast and vague, they know me not. But yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am the heartbreak over fallen things,<br /></span>

public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
